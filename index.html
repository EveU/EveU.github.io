      <p>My interest in programming began as a hobby, taking online courses in my spare time before deciding to make a career change. I found out about <a href="http://www.codeclan.com" target="_blank">CodeClan</a>, Scotland's first Digital Skills Academy, attended an info session, and signed up! Having now completed the 16-week course, I am looking forward to begin my new career as a Software Developer.</p>

          <h3>Language Resources</h3>
          <div class="project-info">
            <img src="img/LanguageResources.png">
            <p>Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL form the back-end API, and ReactJS creates the front-end user interface. The project is a resource site for language learners to browse and search for foreign media, such as books and songs, at an appropriate level for their language ability. Future developments would include filtering functionality and authorisation levels for new content submission.</p>

          <h3>Flight/Hotel Search</h3>
          <div class="project-info">
            <img src="img/Amaroo_package.png">
            <p>A flight and hotel comparison site, built with JavaScript as a team project. The site displays flight and hotel information, and users can search by destination and departure date to receive package deals, ordered by price. Through this project I gained experience collaborating on GitHub, branching off from the main code and merging updates in once signed off by the whole team.</p>

          <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
          <div class="project-info">
            <img src="img/TicTacToe.png">
            <p>An online version of Tic-Tac-Toe created in Ruby on Rails, with game logic implemented through models and associations. Authentication and authorisation control user access, for example only allowing the current player to place a piece. Also includes a basic computer player, and a 'Recent Games' table where users can view previous results and return to incomplete games.</p>
